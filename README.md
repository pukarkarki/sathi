# मेरो साथी
This app takes an image, creates an English caption for it, translates that caption into Nepali, and then reads it out loud. You can upload a picture or use the camera. The app uses a BLIP model for captioning, Google Translator for translation, and gTTS for speech. It works in one place so you can see the image, read the text, and hear the audio.
